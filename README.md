# Python-Neural-Network-for-MNIST

I just made this standard two layer NN with a sigmoid function to practice ML with Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Not much to see. It takes input and cross-validation datasets which I have prepared in .pickle-files, preprocesses them and then executes forward and backward propagation in a loop with a little gradient descent sprinkled in between. For this network I'm using a sigmoid activation function. I'm also plotting the progress of the cost function and finish up with calculating the accuracy.
